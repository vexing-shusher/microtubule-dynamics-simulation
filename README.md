# Simulation of stochastic dynamics of tubulin microtubules
My Bachelor's degree project (Moscow State University, Dept. of Physics): microtubule dynamics simulation.

# Disclaimer
1. This work is not (and was not) intended for publication in any peer-reviewed scientific media. The results presented here may turn out to be not scientifically significant. In essense, I just gave it a go.
2. At the time of working on this project, my programming skills were pretty poor. The code should not contain any bugs, however, I cannot guarantee that :)

# Introduction

## Importance
The construction of a detailed computational model of a microtubule will make it possible to carry out computer simulations of complex experiments (including optical ones) and, even more significantly, will facilitate their interpretation from a theoretical point of view.

## Microtubule properties
1. Dynamic instability
2. Polarity of the ends
3. Ability to generate force
4. Aging
